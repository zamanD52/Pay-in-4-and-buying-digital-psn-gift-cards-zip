What is Pay in 4?
"Pay in 4" is a buy now, pay later service offered by various financial technology companies. This option allows you to split the cost of your purchase into four equal payments, spaced out over time. Typically, the payments are due every two weeks, and depending on the provider, the first installment is often due at the time of purchase. Services like Klarna, Afterpay, and Affirm are some of the well-known platforms that offer "Pay in 4" features, making them a popular choice among shoppers.

Using Pay in 4 helps you buy the products you need without the immediate burden of a full upfront payment. This flexibility allows you to manage your finances better while still enjoying your purchases, especially when it comes to buying digital PSN gift cards.
